            Batman[a] is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created
            by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics
            on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
            playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him
            swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a
            child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually,
            crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators
            accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred
            Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his
            archenemy, the Joker.

            Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane
            frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero
            into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman
            was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved
            into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman
            does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s
            Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for
            years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s
            and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

            DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo
            and Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in
            the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder
            Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce
            Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as Jean-Paul Valley /
            Azrael in the 1993â€“1994 "Knightfall" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace
            Fox, son of Wayne's ally Lucius, as of 2021.[4] DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of
            Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from
            the Flashpoint (2011) event, and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.
